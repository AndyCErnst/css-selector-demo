# CSS Selector Demo

This is a small project demonstrating the precedence of CSS selectors. I found myself frequently explaining how CSS selectors work to people new to website design/development and thought poking at something like this would be a good suppliment.

To try it out, visit http://andycernst.github.io/css-selector-demo/

You can add any number of stylesheets and on the stylesheets you can add any number of element and class selectors. The stylesheets appear in the <head> in the order they are numbered, so later sheets of equal selector weight will override earlier ones.

Ideas on how to develop this further:
. id selector
. important tag
. direct user editing of stylesheets
. better styling

I'd love to hear if this project is useful to you or you have any input you have on how to improve the code base.
